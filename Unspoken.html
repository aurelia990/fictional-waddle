    <p>Seeing the message you sent, I was really devastated. I felt wronged and unwilling, and couldn't help but shed tears. Now there are two choices: start over or get back together. How can I avoid heartache again? After a long thought, I finally chose to refuse. You will never understand how I survived the days without you. I didn't want to eat for almost a week. Every tear I shed for you is my greatest sincerity in loving you, and the loss of control of emotions again and again is my greatest loyalty to this relationship. I was sad every day, and thought of you every time I did anything. I couldn't sleep every night and fell into endless waiting. You will never imagine how strong my heart was when I forced myself to give up the person I loved most dearly. Tears welled up in my eyes unconsciously, but did not flow down. You certainly can't understand the feeling of "coldness". The pain is not on you, and you can't feel the taste of "pain". Those dark nights, those days of holding back tears are only understood by me. You underestimated my ruthlessness. I hate it most when others use my sincerity as a bargaining chip and my kindness as a fool. Sorry! After this, you will be off the shelf!</p>
