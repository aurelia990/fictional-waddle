    <h1>POWERFUL LIFE LESSONS</h1>
    <p>Curated by @nishxmail | Follow for more powerful thoughts & reflections</p>
  </div>  <div class="quotes">
    <div class="quote">1. Learn how to say 'No' and mean it.</div>
    <div class="quote">2. Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.</div>
    <div class="quote">3. Life doesn’t get easier or more forgiving—we get stronger and more resilient.</div>
    <div class="quote">4. Time truly flies. Be grateful always because it can always be worse. Live like there’s no tomorrow, and do what you love. The money will flow.</div>
    <div class="quote">5. Chasing the opposite sex and having temporary relationships (which mean nothing but sex) is pointless.</div>
    <div class="quote">6. If it can be fixed, why are you complaining? If it can’t be fixed, why are you complaining?</div>
    <div class="quote">7. If the path before you is clear, you’re probably on someone else’s.</div>
    <div class="quote">8. A private life is a happy life. Sometimes, it feels better not to talk at all—about anything.</div>
    <div class="quote">9. Don’t say 'yes' to everyone to make them comfortable. Check with yourself too before you commit.</div>
    <div class="quote">10. Every person has three faces: The one we show to the world and strangers, the one we show to family and close friends, and the one we show only to ourselves.</div>
    <div class="quote">11. There is a healthy amount of distrust to have in everyone. Nobody’s intentions are truly clear, even after being stated.</div>
    <div class="quote">12. You aren’t crazy—you’re intelligent. Life is not a matter of holding good cards but of playing a poor hand well.</div>
    <div class="quote">13. Thousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and its life will not get shorter. Happiness doesn’t diminish when you share it.</div>
    <div class="quote">14. At first, you choose a partner based on appearance and enjoy it—until you realize your children will be raised not based on appearance but on values.</div>
    <div class="quote">15. If you expect the world to be fair with you because you’re fair, you’re fooling yourself. That’s like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn’t eat him.</div>
    <div class="quote">16. You can always earn money—it’s not a big deal. Your world isn’t going to end because you don’t have a fixed income. Something else will work out.</div>
    <div class="quote">17. Your friends want you to do good—but not better than them. The rest don’t care.</div>
    <div class="quote">18. The 'average of five' is real. If you want to know someone, look at the five people they talk to most and spend the most time with.</div>
    <div class="quote">19. If you’re trying to break a habit, don’t say, 'This is the last time I’m doing it.' Instead, say, 'This is the first time I’m not doing it.'</div>
